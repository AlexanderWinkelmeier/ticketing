# E-Commerce App: Build, Deploy, and Scale with Microservices

This project demonstrates how to build, deploy, and scale an E-Commerce application using Microservices architecture. The application is built with the following technologies:

- **Node.js** for the backend API and microservices
- **React** and **Next.js** for the frontend user interface and server-side rendering
- **Mongoose** for MongoDB object modeling and data interaction
- **MongoDB-memory-server** for in-memory MongoDB database during tests
- **Axios** for making HTTP requests from the frontend
- **Express-validator** for input validation in the backend
- **Jsonwebtoken** for user authentication with JWT
- **Cookie-session** for session management in the backend
- **Docker** for containerization of services
- **Kubernetes** for orchestration and scaling of containers

## Features

- Microservices architecture for modular, scalable, and maintainable development
- Scalable and containerized deployment using **Docker** and **Kubernetes**
- Full-stack development with **Node.js**, **React**, and **Next.js**
- Robust user authentication using **JWT** and session management via **Cookie-session**
- Easy-to-setup and deploy for production environments
- Fast and efficient data handling with **Mongoose** and **MongoDB-memory-server** for testing
